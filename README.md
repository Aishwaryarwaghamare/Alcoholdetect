##Alcohol Detection System using Arduino
Project Overview
The Alcohol Detection System is a real-time embedded project designed to detect alcohol levels using an MQ-3 sensor and provide visual and audible alerts when the detected level exceeds a pre-defined threshold. This system can be used in vehicles, workplaces, or public spaces to promote safety and prevent accidents caused by alcohol consumption.

##Features
Real-Time Detection: Continuously monitors alcohol levels in the environment.
Alerts:
Visual Alert: An LED lights up when alcohol is detected above the threshold.
Audible Alert: A buzzer sounds when alcohol is detected.
Calibration Mode: Allows for adjusting the threshold based on environmental conditions.
LCD Display: Displays real-time alcohol levels and system status.
Serial Logging: Logs sensor data and system status to the Serial Monitor for debugging or analysis.
Components Used
Arduino Uno - Microcontroller board to process sensor data.
MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor - Detects alcohol concentration.
Buzzer - Provides an audible alert.
LED - Visual indicator for alcohol detection.
16x2 LCD - Displays real-time data and system status.
Push Button - Enables calibration mode.
Resistors and Wires - For connections.
Circuit Diagram
Include a detailed circuit diagram here.
(You can use tools like Fritzing to create a visual schematic and add the image.)

##How It Works
The MQ-3 sensor reads the alcohol concentration and outputs an analog signal to the Arduino.
The Arduino processes the signal and compares it against a threshold.
If the alcohol level exceeds the threshold:
The buzzer and LED are activated.
The LCD displays "ALERT".
The system logs the data to the Serial Monitor for real-time monitoring.
Users can calibrate the threshold by pressing a button, which adjusts sensitivity based on environmental conditions.

##Setup and Usage
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AlcoholDetectionProject.git
cd AlcoholDetectionProject
Upload Code to Arduino:

Open AlcoholDetection.ino in the Arduino IDE or VS Code.
Connect the Arduino Uno to your computer.
Select the correct board (Arduino Uno) and port.
Upload the code.
Connect the Circuit:

Assemble the components as per the circuit diagram.
Run the System:

Monitor real-time alcohol levels on the LCD.
Observe alerts (LED and buzzer) when alcohol is detected.
Use the Serial Monitor for additional data logging.
Applications
Vehicle Safety: Prevent drunk driving by integrating the system into vehicles.
Industrial Use: Monitor alcohol levels in workplaces for safety compliance.
Public Safety: Deploy in public spaces to ensure sobriety.
Future Enhancements
Wireless Alerts: Integrate Wi-Fi or Bluetooth for remote notifications.
Data Logging: Store detection data on an SD card for analysis.
Mobile App: Display alerts and logs on a smartphone application.
